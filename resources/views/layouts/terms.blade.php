          		<tr>
          			<td>

          <p style="text-align: justify;">You acknowledge that you are at all times aware of the required minimum monthly ADB, the service charges, maintenance fees, dormancy fees and penalties applicable for various types of Accounts, products, services, facilities and channels, as the case may be, as well as any amendments, revisions or modification thereto, which fees, charges and penalties are available to you upon request or through various channels of the Bank or are published, displayed, advertised, posted in the ATM on-screen messages or such area near the Bank’s ATM or in conspicuous places within the Bank’s premises and/or posted in the Bank’s website, whichever is applicable, all of which are made integral parts hereof.</p>

          <p style="text-align: justify;">The Bank may waive the maintenance of the monthly ADB. The Bank, however, reserves the right, in its sole discretion and at any time, to lift/cancel such waiver for whatever reason.</p>

          <p style="text-align: justify;">The Bank may, from time to time, revise and/or change the applicable fees, charges, penalties including increases in the required minimum monthly ADB for various types of Accounts, products, services, facilities and channels, as the case may be.

          <p style="text-align: justify;">The savings passbook is issued to assist you in monitoring your transactions and account balance. However, since your Account allows you to transact business even without the savings passbook, through your ATM and such other Bank channels, the amount of balance shown therein will not be conclusive, unless updated and verified by the Bank after comparison with its records.</p>

          <p style="text-align: justify;">In the event of any discrepancy between the entries in the savings passbook and the Bank's records, the latter shall prevail. Savings passbooks are not transferable.

Fractions of foreign currencies may, at the Bank's discretion, be paid in pesos. Conversion rates from one currency to another will be based on the Bank's prevailing buying and selling rates. Service fees may be charged for foreign currency cash withdrawals/deposits. The Bank shall have the right to pay your withdrawal in the currency you require and/or such other currency at the Bank's absolute discretion.</p>

          <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>12. Signature Cards</em></strong> - You agree to complete and submit signature cards containing your specimen signatures or those of your authorized signatory(ies) with authentication by the duly appointed corporate secretary/managing partner/appropriate officer, if a juridical entity, and Customer Information Sheet (CIS) and other required bank forms in such manner and in such frequency as may be required by the Bank, existing laws, and/or applicable BSP and AMLC regulations.</p>

          <p style="text-align: justify;">(b) You can access your Accounts through your Express Teller Card/Data/Number 7 days a week, 24 hours a day. For purposes of dating your transactions on these 7x24 channels, a bank cut-off time has been implemented. All transactions done before the designated bank cut-off shall be posted to your Account on the same day. Transactions after cut-off on a banking day or completed on a Saturday, Sunday or banking holiday, will be posted on the next banking day.</p>

          <p style="text-align: justify;">(c) For the ATM/POS channel, you may be issued, at the sole discretion of the Bank, an Express Teller Card which you may use to access your Accounts through the Bank's or its affiliated ATMs or POS terminals/networks and effect such permitted transactions in relation therewith. You agree to sign the Express Teller Card promptly upon receipt thereof and to keep the Express Teller Card secure at all times.</p>

          <p style="text-align: justify;">(d) You acknowledge that withdrawals/purchases/inquiries on your Accounts through ATMs or POS can be made only by using a valid Express Teller Card together with your correct Personal Identification Number (PIN). A card is valid when it has the correct Joint Account Indicator (JAI), and Sequence Number.</p>

          <p style="text-align: justify;">(e) For ATM/POS channel, you acknowledge that you were provided a Temporary PIN together with the Express Teller Card. This Temporary PIN will allow you to nominate your own personalized PIN as your first ATM transaction. You further acknowledge that this Temporary PIN will not allow you to do any withdrawal/purchase/balance inquiry transaction on your Accounts from any ATM or POS. Full access to your Account may only be made with your personalized PIN. You agree to personally nominate your own PIN promptly upon release of the Express Teller Card and its Temporary PIN. You acknowledge that failing to nominate your PIN within two (2) banking days from date of Express Teller Card release shall automatically deactivate the Express Teller Card's operating status, and in such case, you are required to personally request the branch where the Account is maintained to have the Express Teller Card reactivated.</p>
